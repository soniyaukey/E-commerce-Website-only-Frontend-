OnDaro – E-commerce Website Description

OnDaro is a custom-designed e-commerce website built to offer a simple, smooth, and user-friendly online shopping experience. The main idea behind this project was to create a complete shopping platform where users can easily browse products, filter them by category or price, view details, add items to a cart, and place orders — just like they would on any major online store.

The website features multiple product categories such as Fashion, Electronics, Gaming, Health & Beauty, and more. Each product has its own page with images, description, pricing, and customer ratings. There's also a shopping cart and checkout process that makes the experience feel real and complete.

What makes OnDaro different is its clean design and responsiveness. It works well on both desktop and mobile devices. I used HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend, while the backend is handled using Node.js and Express. Product data is fetched from a local API, and everything from the homepage to the order confirmation page is fully functional.

Apart from the core features, the site also includes an About Us page, a contact form with validation, and a working search page to help users find what they’re looking for.

This project helped me understand how real-world e-commerce platforms work — from layout and navigation to managing dynamic data and improving user experience. It’s not just a demo; it’s a hands-on learning experience that brings all the important elements of web development together in one place.
